Courses based on this module should:

[To be developed.]

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* explain how use of different screen sizes, screen configurations, and style sheets affects the ability of people with disabilities to identify, distinguish, and process websites and applications
* create designs with target sizes and spaces to support tapping by people with mobility impairments and people using different input methods
* create designs that preserve meaningful sequence, content, and functionality when using different viewport sizes, screen configurations, and devices to access content
* create designs that preserve content and functionality when line height as well as spacing between paragraphs, words, and letters are modified by the user
* create designs that support text resizing without loss of content and functionality
* create designs that do not restrict the content view and operation to a single display orientation, such as portrait or landscape
* create designs that support alternatives to multipoint or path-based gestures, such as swipe or pinch
* create designs with mechanisms to undo or abort an action carried out with pointer operations

## Topics to Teach

Topics to achieve the learning outcomes:

### Topic: Zooming, Scrolling, and Resizing

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* create designs that preserve content and functionality when accessed using a variety of screen sizes, screen configurations, and style sheets
* ensure content can be presented without loss of information and functionality, and that accessing such content does not require two-dimensional scrolling:
  * vertical (at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels)
  * horizontall (at a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels)
* create designs that allow text resizing up to 200% without loss of content and functionality
* create designs that allow users to set the orientation to  portrait or landscape, or that include show or hide controls to access contents in portrait and landscape orientations

### Topic: Targets and Spacing

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* create designs that allow users to modify the following properties without loss of content and functionality:
  * line spacing -- to at least 1.5 times the font size
  * spacing following paragraphs -- to at least 2 times the font size
  * letter spacing (tracking) -- to at least 0.12 times the font size
* ensure target sizes that are at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels

### Topic: Input Modalities

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* create designs that support alternatives to multi-pointer gestures (such as swipe or pinch) using single pointer activation
* ensure down event on single pointer gestures:
  * do not perform any action, or
  * have available mechanisms to abort or undo any action carried on
* create designs that support alternatives to device or user motion such as shaking, by using user interface components that do not require motion
* ensure response to motion can be disabled by the user to prevent accidental actuation, such as undoing an action by shaking a device
