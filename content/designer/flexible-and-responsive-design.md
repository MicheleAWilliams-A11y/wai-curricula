## Introduction
{:.no-display}

Courses based on this module should:

[To be developed.]

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* explain how people with disabilities identify and distinguish user interface components based on different features, such as color, layout, spacing, and position
* design user interfaces with landmarks, text cues, patterns, and icons to supplement information conveyed through color alone
* design user interfaces with adjustable font sizes and adequate spacing to support readability
* design user interfaces with appropriate contrast ratios for text, images of text, and controls
* design user interfaces with clear and distinguishable focus indicators, for example using borders, background color, and highlighting
* design user interfaces that support placement of different regions and user interface components where users expect them
* identify related requirements for developers to apply the necessary semantics to user interface components

## Competencies

Skills required for this module:

[To be developed.]

## Topics to Teach

Topics to achieve the learning outcomes:

### Topic: Content Perception

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* design user interfaces with distinguishable styles for different components, such as text, links, buttons, or form elements
* design user interfaces with font sizes that allow content readability
* design user interfaces with adequate spacing to support readability
* design user interfaces with text cues to convey any information that is provided using color alone, such as an asterisk to convey required form fields in a form
* design user interfaces with different patterns, shapes, and icons to supplement information provided only with differences in color
* provide other visual cues, such as underline, bold, and italics, to supplement information conveyed through differences in text color

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

{%- comment -%}

* Demonstrate use of different styles for different user interface components, such as links ,buttons, texts, and menus. Explain how people rely on font sizes, spacing, and typography to distinguish components from one another. For references on how to apply distinguishable styles for user interface components, see @@@
* Demonstrate use of different font sizes and explain how they affect readability of the content. For reference on how to apply font sizes that allow content readability, see @@@
* Show examples of different page layouts with and without adequate spacing. Explain how spacing allow to distinguish different pieces of content from one another. For references on how to apply adequate spacing, see @@@
* Show examples where information is conveyed exclusively with differences sin color, such as a form where required fields are marked in red. Explain that some users cannot perceive color well or at all, so alternative methods to convey that information are required. For references on how to convey information without using color alone, see @@@

### Topic: Contrast Ratios

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:
 
* explain how appropriate contrast ratios allow people with disabilities to read, understand, and distinguish user interface components
* design user interfaces that allow text (including images of text) to have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 with respect to their background
* design user interfaces that allow for large-scale text and images of text to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 with respect to their background
* design user interfaces that allow components and graphics to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 with respect to their background
* design user interfaces with focus indicators that have a contrast ratio that allows them to be perceived by users

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

{%- comment -%}

* Show examples of different foreground and background combinations. Explain how contrast ratios between foreground and background allow users to perceive content and distinguish components from one another. For references on contrast ratios , see @@@
* Show examples of how different pieces of text are perceived depending on their background color. Explain that contrast ratios need to be at least 4.5:1. For references on how to apply contrast ratios to text (including images of text), see @@@
* @@@
* Show examples of different interactive components, such as buttons and links, and explain that they should have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. For techniques on how to add contrast ratios for graphics and interface components, see@@@

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment:

{%- comment -%}

* Short Answer Questions &mdash; Give students a set of user interface components and ask them what the contrast ration should be. Assess how students understand and distinguish contrast ratios for different user interface components.
* Practical &mdash; Students design a paper prototype and apply appropriate contrast ratios to text, images of text, user interface components and graphics. Assess how students understand and apply contrast ratios based on the different user interface components that they are designing

### Topic: Flexible Design

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* explain how the use of different screen sizes, screen configurations, break points, and style sheets affects the ability of people with disabilities to identify, distinguish, and process contents
* design user interfaces that adapt their sequence, content, and functionality when used with different viewport sizes, screen configurations, and devices to access content
* design user interfaces with target sizes and spaces to support tapping by people with mobility impairments and people using different input methods
* design user interfaces that support customizing line height, as well as spacing between paragraphs, words, and letters
* design user interfaces that support text resizing without loss of content and functionality
* design user interfaces that support content view and operation in both portrait and landscape orientations
* design user interfaces that support alternatives to multi-pointer or path-based gestures, such as swipe or pinch
* design user interfaces that support undoing or aborting an action carried out with pointer operations
