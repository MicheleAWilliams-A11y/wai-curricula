Courses based on this module should:

[To be developed.]

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* identify accessibility requirements for different types of audio or video content
* create designs that consider placement of alternatives to multimedia content, such as transcripts for audio and audio described content,
* create designs with mechanisms to switch transcripts and audio described content on or off
* create designs with mechanisms to pause, stop, and hide any moving and auto-updating content, including animations and carousels
* create designs with mechanisms to stop or control the volume of auto-playing audio
* identify related requirements for developers to programmatically associate alternatives and descriptions to their corresponding media content
* identify related requirements for content authors to provide appropriate text alternatives and audio descriptions for different types of media content, including video and audio

## Topics to Teach

Topics to achieve the learning outcomes:

### Topic: Captions and Audio Descriptions

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to

* identify the different types of multimedia content, such as audio and video, and relate them to their corresponding sensory characteristic
* identify the different types of time-based multimedia content, such as pre-recorded and live audio and video
* identify and describe different types of synchronized media, for example a dialog in a movie
* create designs that allow to provide text alternatives for prerecorded audio-only content that presents equivalent information
* create designs that allow to provide either a text alternative or an audio track for a prerecorded video-only content that presents equivalent information
* create designs that allow to provide captions and audio descriptions for any prerecorded and live audio content in synchronized media
* create designs that allow to provide sign language interpretation for all prerecorded audio content in synchronized media

### Topic: Movement and Animations

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* create designs that allow to pause, stop, or hide any content that blinks, moves, or auto-updates
* ensure flashing content is below the general flash and red flash thresholds
* create designs that allow to provide content that does not flash more than three times in a second
* create designs that allow to disable motion animation triggered by interaction, such as additional animations when scrolling
* create designs that support mechanisms to stop or control the volume of any audio that plays automatically for more than 3 seconds
* create designs that prevent changes of context unless the user is aware of them or has explicitly requested such changes
