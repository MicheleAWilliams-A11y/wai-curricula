Courses based on this module should:

[To be developed.]

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* explain strategies that people with disabilities use to navigate web pages and applications
* design user interfaces that support different types of navigational mechanisms, including breadcrumb trails, tables of contents, and site maps
* design user interfaces with mechanisms to bypass blocks of repeated content, such as navigation links and header contents
* design user interfaces with search functionalities to help users find content
* design user interfaces that support accessibility features of multiple menus, such as navigational, fly-out, and application menus
* identify related requirements for developers to:
  * code landmarks and headings appropriately
  * make navigational mechanisms usable with the keyboard and other input devices
  * implement clear and descriptive names for landmarks and headings

## Topics to Teach

Topics to achieve the learning outcomes:

### Topic: Menu Types

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* identify uses of different types of menus, such as navigational, fly-out, and application menus
* design user interfaces that support use of menus with the mouse, keyboard, and touch
* design user interfaces that support expanding and collapsing menu items using different methods, such as hovering, tabbing, and tapping
* design user interfaces that communicate the state of menu items using distinguishable and consistent styles
* identify related requirements for developers to convey different menu states, such as open, closed, expanded, or collapsed

#### Teaching Ideas

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Show examples of different types of menus, such as navigational, fly-out, and application menus. Explain the different scenarios where each of them can be used. For references on the different types of menus, see @@@
* Demonstrate menu interaction using different input devices, such as keyboard, mouse, and touch. Explain that menus need to be operable with all of these input methods. For example, activating a menu option by tapping, pressing the Enter key, or clicking it with the mouse.
* Show examples of different menu interaction patterns, such as expanding an collapsing submenu options. Explain that these patterns need to support interaction with the keyboard, mouse, and touch as well. Emphasize that the states of these menu items need to be communicated using styles, icons, and semantics. Explain that providing the icons and style is a designer's responsibility, whereas providing the underlying code is a developer's responsibility.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge

Optional ideas to support assessment.

[To be developed].

### Topic: Other Navigational Mechanisms

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* design user interfaces that support skipping blocks of repeated content providing at least one of the following:
  * a link at the top of each page that goes directly to the main content area
  * a link at the beginning of a block of repeated content to go to the end of the block
  * links at the top of the page that go to each area of the content
  * an expandable and collapsible menu to make it easier for users to skip the menu
* design user interfaces that support search functionalities for users to find content
* design user interfaces that support breadcrumb trails to provide information about the user's location in a set of web pages
* design user interfaces that support site maps to provide an overview of the entire website
* design user interfaces that support tables of contents to give an overview of the whole website or document and to allow users to go to specific parts of the content

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Show examples of mechanisms to bypass blocks of repeated content, such as a link at the top of the page and the use of expandable and collapsible components. Explain that people using the keyboard only find it very frustrating to navigate through sets of repeated blocks of content, such as navigation bars or header contents. For references on how to provide a mechanism to bypass blocks of repeated content, see @@@
* Show examples of breadcrumb trails. Explain that they provide information about the user's location within the context of a set of websites. Emphasize that they are useful especially in cases where the navigation contains a lot of nested levels. For reference on how to provide breadcrumb trails, see @@@
* Show examples of site maps and explain that they serve the purpose of providing an overview of the whole site. Explain that some users rely on them to better understand the structure of the site and to more easily find its way through it. For references on how to provide a site map, see @@@
* Show examples of tables of contents, for example in an electronic book or document. Explain that they provide an overview of the whole document and allow navigation to specific parts of the content.
