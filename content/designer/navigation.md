[To be developed.]

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* explain strategies that people with disabilities use to navigate and orient themselves in web pages and applications
* design user interfaces with mechanisms to bypass blocks of repeated content, such as navigation links, header contents, or advertisements
* design user interfaces with search functionalities to help users find content
* design user interfaces that support accessibility features of multiple menus, such as navigational, fly-out, and application menus
* design user interfaces that support different types of navigational mechanisms, including breadcrumb trails, tables of contents, and sitemaps
* design user interfaces that support placement of different regions and user interface components where users expect them
* provide headings and landmarks to identify different regions of a page or application
* identify related requirements for developers to:
  * code landmarks and headings appropriately
  * make navigational mechanisms usable with the keyboard and other input devices
  * provide clear and descriptive names for landmarks and headings

## Topics to Teach

Topics to achieve the learning outcomes:

### Topic: Navigational Mechanisms

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* design user interfaces that support skipping blocks of repeated content providing at least one of the following:
  * a link at the top of each page that goes directly to the main content area
  * a link at the beginning of a block of repeated content to go to the end of the block
  * links at the top of the page that go to each area of the content
  * an expandable and collapsible menu to make it easier for users to skip the menu
* design user interfaces with site maps to provide an overview of the entire website
* design user interfaces with breadcrumb trails to provide information about the user's location in a set of web pages
* design user interfaces with tables of contents to give an overview of the whole website or document and to allow users to go to specific parts of the content
