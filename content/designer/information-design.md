Courses based on this module should:

[To be developed.]

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* explain how different types of information, including textual, tabular, or graphical, are processed differently by various groups of people with disabilities
* describe approaches to break down different types of content into smaller and more manageable pieces, including:
  * the use of headings and pages to divide longer passages of text into smaller pieces
  * the use of lists, simpler tables, and plain text to convey information presented in complex tables
  * the use of labels and instructions to make information in forms more understandable
  * the use of groups of form controls that share a common purpose
  * the use of search functionalities that allow to select small amounts of data from large data sets
* describe accessibility challenges created when visualizing and interacting with large amounts of data, and describe ways to split these data into smaller chunks
* describe ways to supplement information presented in text, including use of graphics, color, or shapes
* design user interfaces that consider descriptions for images and graphics, including charts or diagrams
* identify related requirements for developers to programmatically associate text alternatives, headings, table header and data cells, and form labels and instructions, to their corresponding control

## Topics to Teach

Topics to achieve the learning outcomes:

### Topic: Textual Information

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* create designs that support additional ways to convey information presented in text, such as required form fields, using icons, shapes, and colors
* create designs that support mechanisms to identify specific definitions of words and meaning of phrases, such as professional terms, idioms, and jargon
* create designs that support mechanisms to identify the expanded form or meaning of acronyms and abbreviations
* create designs with clear language and easy-to-read content wherever possible
* describe related requirements for developers to make language programmatically determined
* describe related requirements for content authors to provide clear language and easy-to-read texts whenever possible

### Topic: Tabular Information

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* define the following types of tables from an accessibility perspective
  * simple
  * complex
  * layout
* create designs that allow presentation of tables in multiple ways, such as using several lists, or splitting a complex table into several simpler ones
* create designs that allow to establish a relationship between the table cells both visually and programmatically, included for headers and data cells
* create designs that support the inclusion of table  descriptions
* describe related requirements for developers to ensure that table header and data cells are programmatically associated

### Topic: Grouping and Sorting Information

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* ensure related form controls, such as those collecting personal information, payment methods, and consent to legal conditions are presented each in its corresponding step of the form or are grouped together in a way its relationship is apparent to all users
* ensure examples of expected input are provided, such as how a phone number should be entered and what the different credit card fields should contain
* ensure related links, such as those from a navigation menu or from a product category are grouped together visually and programmatically

### Topic: Journeys and Flows

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* ensure different products of a store and parts of the content are accessible through different user journeys, such as a navigation menu and a search functionality
* create designs that support robust and understandable grouping of information, such as grouping related information in the same form step and categorizing similar products under the same section
* ensure information that is presented  visually can also be accessed through different means, for example through equivalent descriptions of a product image
