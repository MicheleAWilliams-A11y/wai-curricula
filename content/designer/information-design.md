Courses based on this module should:

[To be developed.]

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* explain how people with disabilities perceive and access different types of information and perform different tasks within websites and applications
* explain the use of headings and pages to divide longer passages of text into smaller pieces
* describe supplemental ways to convey information presented in text, such as using graphics, color, or shapes
* describe the accessibility challenges that complex tables create, including the difficulty to process the relationships between header and data cells and the need to scroll horizontally and vertically to visualize the contents
* explain different ways to present information in tables, including splitting complex tables into simpler tables, lists, and plain text where possible
* manage the accessibility implications of different processes (including user journeys and workflows), for example different methods to perform a task within a website or application
* describe the accessibility challenges in form fields, including THE difficulty to relate labels to form controls and the difficulty to understand the purpose of form fields
* describe ways to make forms more understandable, for example providing labels and instructions and grouping related form fields into their corresponding step
* identify related requirements for developers to programmatically associate table header cells to their corresponding data cells
* identify related requirements for developers to programmatically associate instructions for form controls to their corresponding control
* identify related requirements for developers to programmatically associate headings to their corresponding text

## Topics to Teach

Topics to achieve the learning outcomes:

### Topic: Textual Information

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* create designs that support additional ways to convey information presented in text, such as required form fields, using icons, shapes, and colors
* create designs that support mechanisms to identify specific definitions of words and meaning of phrases, such as professional terms, idioms, and jargon
* create designs that support mechanisms to identify the expanded form or meaning of acronyms and abbreviations
* create designs that support alternatives to text that require reading ability more advanced than the lower secondary education level
* describe related requirements for developers to make language of page and language of parts programmatically determined
* describe related requirements for content authors to provide texts that do not require reading ability more advanced than the lower secondary education level

### Topic: Tabular Information

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* define the following types of tables from an accessibility perspective
  * simple
  * complex
  * layout
* create designs that allow presentation of tables in multiple ways, such as using several lists, or splitting a complex table into several simpler ones
* create designs that allow to establish a relationship between the table cells both visually and programmatically, included for headers and data cells
* create designs that support the inclusion of table  descriptions
* describe related requirements for developers to ensure that table header and data cells are programmatically associated

### Topic: Grouping and Sorting Information

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* ensure related form controls, such as those collecting personal information, payment methods, and consent to legal conditions are presented each in its corresponding step of the form or are grouped together in a way its relationship is apparent to all users
* ensure examples of expected input are provided, such as how a phone number should be entered and what the different credit card fields should contain
* ensure related links, such as those from a navigation menu or from a product category are grouped together visually and programmatically

### Topic: Journeys and Flows

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* ensure different products of a store and parts of the content are accessible through different user journeys, such as a navigation menu and a search functionality
* create designs that support robust and understandable grouping of information, such as grouping related information in the same form step and categorizing similar products under the same section
* ensure information that is presented  visually can also be accessed through different means, for example through equivalent descriptions of a product image
