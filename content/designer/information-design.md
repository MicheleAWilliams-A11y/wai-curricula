[To be developed.]

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* explain how different types of information, including textual, tabular, or graphical information, are processed differently by different groups of people with disabilities
* explain the use of headings and pages to divide longer passages of text into smaller pieces
* describe the accessibility challenges that complex tables create, including the difficulty to process the relationships between header and data cells and the need to scroll horizontally and vertically to visualize the table contents
* explain different ways to present information in tables, including splitting complex tables into simpler tables, lists, and plain text where possible
* describe the accessibility challenges in form fields, including THE difficulty to relate labels to form controls and the difficulty to understand the purpose of form fields
* describe methods to make forms more understandable, including labels and instructions 
* create designs that support grouping related form fields (such as those to enter dates or addresses) into their corresponding step of the process
* describe accessibility challenges created when visualizing and interacting with large amounts of data, and describe ways to split these data into shorter chunks
* identify related requirements for developers to programmatically associate headings to their corresponding text
* identify related requirements for developers to programmatically associate table header cells to their corresponding data cells
* identify related requirements for developers to programmatically associate instructions for form controls to their corresponding control

## Topics to Teach

Topics to achieve the learning outcomes:

### Topic: Textual Information

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* create designs that support additional ways to convey information presented in text, such as required form fields, using icons, shapes, and colors
* create designs that support mechanisms to identify specific definitions of words and meaning of phrases, such as professional terms, idioms, and jargon
* create designs that support mechanisms to identify the expanded form or meaning of acronyms and abbreviations
* create designs with clear language and easy-to-read content wherever possible
* describe related requirements for developers to make language programmatically determined
* describe related requirements for content authors to provide clear language and easy-to-read texts whenever possible

### Topic: Tabular Information

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* define the following types of tables from an accessibility perspective
  * simple
  * complex
  * layout
* create designs that allow presentation of tables in multiple ways, such as using several lists, or splitting a complex table into several simpler ones
* create designs that allow to establish a relationship between the table cells both visually and programmatically, included for headers and data cells
* create designs that support the inclusion of table  descriptions
* describe related requirements for developers to ensure that table header and data cells are programmatically associated

### Topic: Grouping and Sorting Information

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* ensure related form controls, such as those collecting personal information, payment methods, and consent to legal conditions are presented each in its corresponding step of the form or are grouped together in a way its relationship is apparent to all users
* ensure examples of expected input are provided, such as how a phone number should be entered and what the different credit card fields should contain
* ensure related links, such as those from a navigation menu or from a product category are grouped together visually and programmatically

### Topic: Journeys and Flows

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* ensure different products of a store and parts of the content are accessible through different user journeys, such as a navigation menu and a search functionality
* create designs that support robust and understandable grouping of information, such as grouping related information in the same form step and categorizing similar products under the same section
* ensure information that is presented  visually can also be accessed through different means, for example through equivalent descriptions of a product image
