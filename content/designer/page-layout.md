[To be developed.]

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* explain how people with disabilities identify and distinguish user interface components based on different features such as color, layout, spacing, and position
* create designs with appropriate contrast ratios between foreground user interface components, including text, images of text, and controls, and their corresponding background
* create designs with appropriate font sizes to support content processing
* create designs with adequate spacing to help distinguish different user interface components from one another
* creaate designs with color, visual cues, and text to convey information
* create designs with clear and distinguishable focus indicators, for example using borders, background color, and highlighting

## Topics to Teach

Topics to achieve the learning outcomes:

### Topic: Contrast Ratios

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* explain how appropriate contrast ratios allow people with disabilities to read, understand, and distinguish user interface components
* create designs that allow text and images of text to have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 with respect to their background
* create designs that allow for large-scale text and images of text to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 with respect to their background
* create designs that allow user interface components and graphical elements to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 with respect to their background
* ensure focus indicators have a contrast ratio that allows them to be perceived by users

### Topic: Section and Content Identification

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* ensure distinguishable styles are applied to different page regions, such as header, navigation, main, and footer
* ensure distinguishable styles are used for different components, such as text, links, buttons, or form elements
* create designs that allow for text cues to convey any information that is provided using color alone, such as an asterisk to convey required form fields in a form
* ensure that information provided using differences in color is also provided using different patterns, shapes, and icons
* ensure that information conveyed through differences in text color is also conveyed using other visual cues, such as underline, bold, and italics

### Topic: Page Structure 

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* provide distinctive styles and descriptive names for each of the page regions, headings, and for individual user interface components such as links, buttons, or form fields
* ensure positioning of page regions falls under user expectations, such as headers at the top, footers at the bottom, and navigation regions at the top left in a desktop view
* ensure heading levels a-6 are used to convey the hierarchical structure of the content
* identify related requirements for developers to ensure headings are coded appropriately, perceived by assistive technologies, and nested according to the specifications
