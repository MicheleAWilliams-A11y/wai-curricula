## Introduction
{:.no-display}

The designer modules guide the creation of courses that:

* explain how design principles and practices relate to accessibility
* demonstrate and explain how accessible design enables people with disabilities to use websites and applications
* teach accessible design techniques for:
  * visual design
  * information design
  * navigation design
  * interaction design
  * user experience

These modules have been organized for designers whose work is clsoely related to the knowledge discussed in the [developer modules](/curricula/developer-modules/). If you are teaching other type of designers, feel free to change the structure so that it fits your audience needs.

These modules focus on visual, information, user experience, and interaction aspects to design accessible web pages and applications.

The modules primarily address the following roles:

* Visual Designer
* Information Architect
* User Experience (UX) Designer
* Interaction Designer
