## Introduction

Courses based on this module should:

[To be developed.]

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* explain strategies that people with disabilities use to identify, distinguish, and operate interactive user interface components, such as forms and custom widgets
* create designs with mechanisms to operate all interactive user interface components with the keyboard
* provide clear and distinguishable names to identify interactive user interface components, such as form fields and custom widgets
* provide clear instructions to help understand the purpose of user interface components, such as form fields or custom widgets
* provide meaningful and descriptive notifications about imminent time limits, status changes, and feedback from user input, including errors, suggestions for correction, and success messages
* create designs with meaningful sequence of interactive user interface components
* create designs that preserve visibility and operability both individually and in the context of a rich application
* define custom interaction patterns, such as where to place focus when a dialog is open and closed, and what the focus order should be within those dialogs
* define mechanisms to obtain information about custom interaction patterns, such as specific keyboard shortcuts for applications and expected behavior of custom widgets
* identify related requirements for developers to use native HTML elements to the extent possible and describe their benefits in relation to non-native elements
* identify related requirements for developers to programmatically associate properties of custom user interface components, such as names, states, and instructions to their corresponding component
* identify related requirements for developers to write code for specific keyboard interactions that custom widgets may require

## Topics to Teach

Topics to achieve the learning outcomes:

### Topic: Keyboard Input

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* provide designs that support operation with the keyboard
* describe related requirements for developers to ensure every user interface component can be entered, operated, and exited using the keyboard only
* identify situations when it may be necessary to provide  additional keyboard shortcuts, for example when designing a custom functionality
* create designs that allow provision of keyboard shortcuts that avoid conflicts with the operating system, browser, and assistive technologies keyboard shortcuts
* create designs that allow for consistent focus indicators through the whole widget or application lifetime

### Topic: Labels and Instructions

#### Learning outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* provide overall labels and instructions to help users understand the purpose and intent of interactive user interface components, such as names for form fields and custom widgets and instructions about how to operate custom widgets
* create designs that allow to position labels where users expect them, for example
  * labels for form fields to the left of the field or above in left-to-right languages, or to the right of the field or above it in right-to-left languages
  * labels for radio buttons or checkboxes to the right of the field or below it in left-to-right languages or to the left of the field or below it in right-to-left languages
* provide instructions about which input fields are required by:
  * including information about each of the required form fields before the form control
  * including text, icons, and color in the label of each of the required form fields that indicates that they are required
* provide clear instructions about changes in context that happen when there is a change  on a control before the control, for example when launching a new window when the user checks a check box or selects a list item
* provide overall instructions about existing time limits in a form and about how they can be turned off, adjusted, or extended
* provide clear instructions about the current step and about the total number of steps involved in a multi-step form
* identify related requirements for developers to ensure that labels and instructions are programmatically associated to their corresponding user interface component

### Topic: Help and Error Prevention

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* create designs that support identification of form fields with automatically detected errors
* create designs that support textual descriptions of errors that can be automatically identified
* provide labels and  instructions about how data should be entered, such as date formats and specific ways to introduce identification and phone numbers
* create designs that support provision of suggestions for input errors that are automatically detected when these suggestions are known
* create designs that support reversing, checking, and confirming data entered by the user at least for the following types of information
  * financial
  * legal
  * modifications and deletions of user-controllable data  collected in data storage systems
  * submissions of user test responses
* create designs that support context help methods for form fields, such as a "help" link next to the form

### Topic: Feedback and Notifications

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* ensure notification messages are easy to understand and can be distinguished from any other user interface component
* provide textual information about errors, successes, or any other event resulting from user input
* create designs that allow to switch notifications on or off to allow notifications processing at the users pace
* identify different types of notifications based on their priority, relevance, and relation to specific parts of the application or to the application as a whole
* create designs that support mechanisms to queue and prioritize application notifications coming from different interactive user interface components, such as form fields and custom widgets
* describe related requirements for developers to ensure that notification messages are associated to their corresponding user interface component and can be rendered by assistive technologies
