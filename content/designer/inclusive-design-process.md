[To be developed.]

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* describe how involving users with disabilities early and throughout in the design and development process leads to better accessibility of websites and applications
* explain strategies and assistive technologies that people with disabilities use to interact with the Web
* identify the scope of accessibility in inclusive design processes
* research and communicate applicable design requirements, such as those defined by accessibility standards and policies
* manage the recruitment and involvement of people with disabilities for the different user research activities of a project, including in focus groups, personas, scenarios, and usability testing
* manage representation of diverse groups of users with disabilities, including people with various levels of skills using assistive technologies and adaptive strategies
* describe different means to communicate with people with disabilities, such as use of braille or sign language 
* describe and apply ethical considerations to consider when working with people with disabilities
* describe ways to make documentation for user research activities accessible to people with disabilities, including the use of accessible digital formats
* explain and select different testing methods depending on different types of disabilities, for example wireframe testing for people who have vision or screen reader testing for people who are blind
