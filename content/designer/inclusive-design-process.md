Courses based on this module should:

[To be developed.]

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* explain how involving users with disabilities early and throughout in the design and development process leads to better accessibility of websites and applications
* explain strategies and assistive technologies that people with disabilities use to interact with the Web
* identify the scope of accessibility in inclusive design processes and relate accessibility to usability and inclusion
* research and communicate applicable design requirements, such as those defined by accessibility standards and policies
* manage the involvement of people with disabilities for the different user research activities of a project, including focus groups, personas, scenarios, and usability testing
* manage representation of diverse groups of users with disabilities, including people with various levels of skills using assistive technologies and adaptive strategies
* describe different accommodation means for involving people with disabilities in user research activities
* describe and apply ethical considerations when working with people with disabilities, for example avoiding clich√©s and myths
* describe accessibility characteristics and limitations of different testing methods, such as paper prototype testing and screen reader testing
* describe related requirements for project owners to involve people with disabilities early and throughout in the design and development processes

## Topics to Teach

Topics to achieve the learning outcomes:

### Topic: User Research

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* explain the use of different assistive technologies and adaptive strategies by various groups of people with disabilities to interact with websites and applications
* define  user groups that include different types of users with disabilities
* research different types of accessibility barriers and features, such as appropriate contrast ratios and meaningful page structure
* research accessibility guidelines, standards, and policies, 
* determine the characteristics of participants in user research activities based on different factors, such as overall project requirements, level of skills, use of assistive technology, and type of disability
* manage involvement of people with disabilities early and throughout the research processes, including in focus groups, questionnaires, and surveys
* identify related requirements for project managers to include accessibility in the overall project requirements

### Topic: Establishing Requirements

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* consider different functional requirements that relate to people with disabilities, for example:
  * appropriate contrast ratios
  * availability of content and functionality in different screen sizes and configurations
  * keyboard compatibility
  * use with assistive technologies and adaptive strategies
  * consider different non functional accessibility requirements, for example WCAG and applicable accessibility policies
* create personas that include people with different types of disabilities and different levels of skills using the Web
* create scenarios that include use of the website or application with different types of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies

### Topic: Testing

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* involve people with disabilities in all stages where testing is scheduled, for example in testing prototypes, iterative testing phases, and  usability testing
* consider the following factors when testing needs to be conducted at a specific location:
  * location and accessibility of the facilities
  * assistive technology needs
  * custom setups that users may require
  * accessibility of transportation means
* ensure appropriate timings for participants to carry on activities is allocated, for example different time sets for different levels of experience with the assistive technology and different levels of familiarity with the website or application
