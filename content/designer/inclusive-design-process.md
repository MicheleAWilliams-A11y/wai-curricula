## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* explain how involving users with disabilities in the design and development process leads to better accessibility
* identify the scope of accessibility in inclusive design processes and relate accessibility to usability and inclusion
* research and communicate applicable design requirements for accessibility, such as those defined by accessibility standards and policies
* research and communicate different methods to involve people with disabilities depending on the project scope and the planned research activities
* research and communicate different accommodation needs for people with disabilities
* research and communicate user needs of diverse groups of people with disabilities, including people with various levels of skills using assistive technologies and adaptive strategies
* research and communicate accessibility characteristics and limitations of different testing methods, such as paper prototype testing and screen reader testing
* describe related requirements for product owners and other team roles to plan for the involvement of people with disabilities
