[To be developed.]

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* explain how involving users with disabilities in the design and development process leads to better accessibility
* identify the scope of accessibility in inclusive design processes and relate accessibility to usability and inclusion
* research and communicate applicable design requirements, such as those defined by accessibility standards and policies
* manage direct or indirect involvement of people with disabilities for the different user research activities of a project
* describe different accommodation needs for people with disabilities
* manage representation of diverse groups of users with disabilities, including people with various levels of skills using assistive technologies and adaptive strategies
* describe and apply ethical considerations when working with people with disabilities, for example avoiding clich√©s and myths
* describe accessibility characteristics and limitations of different testing methods, such as paper prototype testing and screen reader testing
* describe related requirements for product owners and other team roles to plan for the involvement of people with disabilities early and throughout in the design and development processes
