## Introduction
{:.no-display}

Courses based on this module should:

* discuss aspects related to involving people with disabilities when conducting user research activities
* discuss the impact of involving people with disabilities to create more accessible designs

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* explain how involving people with disabilities can lead to more accessible designs
* assess and communicate the need for involvement of people with disabilities
* examine applicable design requirements for accessibility, such as those defined by accessibility standards and policies
* articulate the potential risks of not involving people with disabilities
* describe different accommodation needs for people with disabilities
* identify related requirements for product owners and other team roles to plan for the involvement of people with disabilities

## Competencies

Skills required for this module:

[To be developed.]

## Topics to Teach

Topics to achieve the learning outcomes:

### Topic: Assessing the Involvement of People with Disabilities

Explain how involving people with disabilities can lead to more accessible designs. Discuss scenarios where including real people with disabilities may not be feasible and present possible workarounds, for example requesting for experts advice and adhering to established best practices. Explain the potential risks of not involving people with disabilities.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* describe the impact of including real people with disabilities in user research activities
* describe desktop research activities to conduct when it is not possible to include real people with disabilities, such as asking for experts advice, or following documented best practices
* articulate and communicate the potential risks of not involving people with disabilities, for example higher costs to implement accessibility at a later stage

### Topic: User Research

Refer back to [foundation module 2: People and Digital Technology](/curricula/foundation-modules/people-and-digital-technology/). Discuss how organizations conducting user research can include different accessibility features, barriers, and requirements that relate to people with disabilities. 

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* describe the impact of including real people with disabilities in user research activities
* describe desktop research activities to conduct when it is not feasible to include real people with disabilities, such as asking for experts advice, or following documented best practices
* articulate and communicate the consequences of not involving people with disabilities, for example higher costs to implement accessibility at a later stage
* describe the characteristics of potential participants in user research activities based on different factors, such as overall project requirements, type of disability, and level of skills using assistive technologies and adaptive strategies
* identify related requirements for project managers and other team members to include accessibility in the overall project requirements

### Topic: Establishing Requirements

Present accessibility standards (such as WCAG2) and policies that apply in the students' region. Discuss functional and non-functional requirements related to people with disabilities.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* consider different functional requirements that relate to people with disabilities, for example:
  * appropriate contrast ratios
  * availability of content and functionality in different screen sizes and configurations
  * keyboard compatibility
  * compatibility with assistive technologies and adaptive strategies
* identify different non-functional accessibility requirements, for example those included in WCAG and in applicable accessibility policies
* identify and create personas that include people with different types of disabilities and different levels of skills using the Web
* identify scenarios that include use of the product with different types of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies

### Topic: Including Real People with Disabilities

Discuss different aspects to consider when working with real people with disabilities.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* assess and communicate the need for including real people with disabilities depending on the project scope and the activities to be conducted
* articulate the advantages and disadvantages of remote versus face-to-face participation when working with people with disabilities
* articulate the advantages and disadvantages of guided and non-guided testing
* identify the following needs when research activities are conducted at a specific location:
  * accessibility of the facilities
  * assistive technology needs
  * custom setups that people with disabilities may require
  * accessibility of transportation means to get to the chosen venue
* identify the need for appropriate timings for participants with different levels of skills to conduct the research activities
* relate different testing methods to different accessibility outcomes

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Discuss the different levels of skills of people with disabilities when using an assistive technology or an adaptive strategy. Emphasize that some assistive technologies and adaptive strategies are difficult to learn. Explain that different people may need different timings to conduct the proposed activities. For example, setting up different time expectations depending on different levels of experience with the assistive technology and different levels of familiarity with the website or application
* Explain different testing methods that exist, such as testing with an assistive technology, testing a paper prototype, or testing an HTML template. Explain that each of these methods delivers different types of outputs. For example, testing a paper prototype is more likely to deliver results related to vision, and assistive technology testing is more likely to deliver results related to the compatibility of the product with assistive technology.
