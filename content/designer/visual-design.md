Courses based on this module should:

[To be developed.]

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* explain how people with disabilities identify and distinguish user interface components based on different features, such as color, layout, spacing, and position
* design user interfaces with means to supplement information conveyed visually, for example using headings, lists, and textual information
* design user interfaces with appropriate contrast ratios for text, images of text, and controls
* design user interfaces with appropriate font sizes to support content processing
* design user interfaces with adequate spacing to help distinguish different components from one another
* design user interfaces with text cues, patterns, and icons to supplement information conveyed through color
* design user interfaces with clear and distinguishable focus indicators, for example using borders, background color, and highlighting

## Topics to Teach

Topics to achieve the learning outcomes:

### Topic: Contrast Ratios

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:
 
* explain how appropriate contrast ratios allow people with disabilities to read, understand, and distinguish user interface components
* design user interfaces that allow text and images of text to have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 with respect to their background
* design user interfaces that allow for large-scale text and images of text to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 with respect to their background
* design user interfaces that allow components and graphics to have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 with respect to their background
* design user interfaces with focus indicators that have a contrast ratio that allows them to be perceived by users

### Topic: Content Perception

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* design user interfaces with distinguishable styles for different page regions, such as header, navigation, main, and footer
* design user interfaces with distinguishable styles for different components, such as text, links, buttons, or form elements
* design user interfaces with font sizes to perceive and distinguish content
* design user interfaces with text cues to convey any information that is provided using color alone, such as an asterisk to convey required form fields in a form
* provide information using different patterns, shapes, and icons to supplement information provided only with differences in color
* provide other visual cues, such as underline, bold, and italics, to supplement information conveyed through differences in text color
