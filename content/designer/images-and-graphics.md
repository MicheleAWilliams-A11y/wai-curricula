Courses based on this module should:

[To be developed.]

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* explain how images affect processing of information, content identification, and understanding of functionality by people with disabilities
* identify and describe different uses of images within a user interfaces, including informative, functional, and decorative
* provide appropriate text alternatives for graphical components included in the design phase, such as logos, links, and menu items
* describe ways to supplement information presented in text, including use of graphics, color, or shapes
* provide equivalent textual information that helps identify the purpose of an image conveying function
* design user interfaces that consider descriptions for images and graphics, including charts or diagrams
* identify related requirements for developers to code images and text alternatives appropriately
* identify related requirements for content authors to provide appropriate text alternatives for images included in the authoring phase
* identify related requirements for content authors to present information as text wherever possible, instead of using images of text

## Competencies

Skills required for this module:

[To be developed.]

## Topics to Teach

Topics to achieve the learning outcomes:

### Topic: Text Alternatives and Descriptions

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* identify and describe different uses of images to convey information
* provide text alternatives that present equivalent information as that contained in the image
* describe related requirements for content authors to provide descriptive, equivalent textual information to understand complex images and graphics, such as diagrams or charts

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Show examples of different images that convey information, such as images to provide instructions, or to identify objects. Explain that such information needs to be provided using text alternatives, so that the purpose of the image can be understood without having to look at the image. For references on how to provide text alternatives for images, see

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment:

[To be developed.]

### Topic: Images Conveying Function

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* identify and describe different uses of images and graphics to convey function
* provide short text alternatives for controls and components that accept user input, for example search, print, and save buttons
* provide text alternatives that identify and describe the purpose of human verification systems, such as captcha 
* manage the provision of several modalities of captcha that rely on different sensory characteristics, such as visual, auditory, and logical

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Show examples of different images used to convey functionality, such as for printing, searching, or saving. Explain that it is necessary to provide  and equivalent, succinct text alternative that explain the function rather than a description of the image. For reference on how  to provide a text alternative for an image conveying function, see
* Show examples of different verification systems, such as captcha, to identify human beings trying to access a service or system. Explain that these mechanisms need to support several sensory characteristics, such as visual, auditory, or cognitive. SFor references on how to provide accessible captcha, see

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment:

[To be developed.]

### Topic: Decorative Images

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* identify and describe different uses of images with decorative meaning
* identify related requirements for developers to code decorative images appropriately
